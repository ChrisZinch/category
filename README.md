The goal is to create a category tree, with infinite depth.
The result should be something like this:

![Example](docs/task.png)

Your solution should include next features:
- Ability to add new subcategories for each category.
- Rename category.
- Delete category (if it has children - delete them as well).
- Expand/Collapse parent category (children categories should collapse too).
